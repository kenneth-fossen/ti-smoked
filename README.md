## Rewrite it in Rust (RIIR)

It is supposed to be so much better.
Anyway, a small play attempt to rewrite a Smoketesting tool that we use at work.

To run form repo:
```sh
> cargo run --release -- <env>
```

If not build it, and run it:
```sh
> cargo build --release
> ./target/release/ti-smoked <env>
```

`<env>` is anything you call the configuration files stored in local.

I learned a lot by doing this silly project and it was fun :)
Happy coding
